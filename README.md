> Publish on MQTT when a dash button is pressed.

Based on [node-dash-button](https://github.com/hortinstein/node-dash-button) by [Alex Hortin](https://github.com/hortinstein) - all credits belong to him.

## Getting started

#### Install

```sudo npm install -g dashbutton2mqtt```

#### Find dash buttons

```sudo dashbutton2mqtt --scan```

#### Create a JSON mapping file

Create a JSON file that maps dash button mac addresses to MQTT topics an payloads. 

Example:
```javascript
{
    "50:f5:da:60:20:10": {
        "topic": "dashbutton/foo",
        "payload": "press"
    },
    "50:f5:da:60:20:11": {
        "topic": "dashbutton/bar",
        "payload": "press"
    }
}

```

#### Start 

```sudo dashbutton2mqtt -m /path/to/mapping.json```  

#### Caveats

* Since node-dash-button uses libpcap to scan for dash button arp packets this tool must be run with superuser.
* Due to the nature of the dash buttons there will be a latency of ~4 seconds between a button press and the MQTT publish.
* As long as the LED of the dash button is blinking you can't do further button presses.

#### Run as service

I suggest [PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2) to run dashbutton2mqtt in the background and start on system boot.
